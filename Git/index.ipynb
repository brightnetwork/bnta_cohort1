    "# Git and GitHub (60 Minute)\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** Students will use ```git``` commands and the ```github.com``` web site while working on labs, mini projects, and final capstone projects. The ```git``` command line interface is a great tool for managing and collaborating on software development projects. It allows you to safely save each new version of a project under development, and it can be a life-saver in situations where you need to back out of a change that did not work out well. Git can be used purely locally to manage changes in a single person project in an isolated local git repo. However, it really shines in a multi-person project scenario, involving local repos that interact with a centralized remote repo, such as on ```github.com```.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```github.com``` website is the most popular Git server on the web. It is a great way to collaborate with co-workers around the world. It can also be useful as a link in your resume, showcasing your own coding portfolio to introduce potential employers to many examples of your great programming abilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to tight time limitations, we will only focus on a fairly simple subset of Git capabilities here. Git is a powerful tool that can be used in complex ways, and it requires substantial time and effort to master. However, even very experienced programmers typically use only a basic subset of Git capabilities, most of the time. So, we will focus on this basic set of Git functionalities.\n",

    "* A Git **repository** is a container for a project that is tracked by Git\n",
    "* Two major types of Git repositories:\n",
    "    - **local repository** is a private repository stored on your local computer\n",
    "    - **remote repository** is a repository stored on a shared access remote server (e.g. github.com)\n",
    "* **working directory** is where you work on making changes to your source code\n",
    "* **staging area** (a.k.a. **index**) contains files to be a part of the next commit\n",
    "* **snapshot** is the state of your code at a specific point in time\n",
    "* **commit** commits a checkpoint (snapshot) of your project state from staging to local repository\n",
    "* **branch** is an active line of development\n",
    "* **tip** is the most recent commit on a branch\n",
    "* **HEAD** is the tip of the current branch\n",
    "* **main** is the main development branch (**GitHub** changed the default name from **master** to **main** in 2020)\n",
    "* **origin** is the default upstream repository\n",
    "* **push** updates the remote repository from local repository\n",
    "* **clone** clones a repository from remote repository into a new local directory"
