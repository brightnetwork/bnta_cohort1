    "**NOTE:** To start exploring **bash** commands, we recommend using a **docker container image**, such as **Ubuntu**. This is to avoid making accidental changes to your local host operating system. For quick and simple experimentation, you can also use a convenient online **bash REPL**, such as https://repl.it/languages/bash. However, an online REPL is limited by permissions on what you can do. The https://repl.it/languages/bash web page has two panels. The panel on the left allows you to edit and run bash shell scripts that write output to the right panel. You can also run individual bash commands interactively in the right panel.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** Starting with **macOS Catalina**, the default login shell has been changed from **bash** to **zsh**, which is mostly backward compatible with **bash**. **Windows 10** now allows you to enable **WLS** (Windows Subsystem for Linux) which allows you to install a free Bash shell from Microsoft Store. However, we still recommend using a docker container image, such as **Ubuntu**, or an online **bash REPL**, such as https://repl.it/languages/bash, for learning purposes.\n",

    "BASH is a very large an deep topic. We only look at the tip of the iceberg on this topic here. It takes years to become highly skilled and efficient in its broad usage. The purpose of this topic is only to raise awareness of this very important tool and to encourage the student to eventually go further. Over time, to become a truly successful Software Developer, you will need to become comfortable with this very important topic.\n",

    "## Why Use Bash?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bash is a low-level command language for manipulating and managing all aspects of an operating system. It can be used for creating, copying, moving, and deleting files on the file system. It can be used to create users and setting permissions for those users. It can be used for downloading files over the internet, starting and stopping programs and operating system services, configuring firewalls and web servers, as well as installing and uninstalling applications. Virtually anything you can do on a computer can be done using Bash commands. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, you may be wondering if Bash is really necessary. After all, these operations can all be done using a nice easy to use graphical user interface instead. Windows and Mac users typically do virtually all these tasks using an intuitive and easy to use desktop GUI interface. Linux also has a variety of GUI desktop alternatives, including KDE, GNOME, and Xfce, which can make life easier for end users that really just want to get on with their actual work.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, programmers and administrators often need to have greater control of the operating system that may be more complex than what can be done in a GUI interface. Often, when they configure a system, they need it to make it repeatable and reliable as an automated executable script. In fact, many Linux servers run \"headless\", which means they have no GUI interface installed. Developers and administrators then need to remote into the server using SSH to issue bash commands. So, although it may not be obvious to the average end user, you, as a software developer, will find that Bash is an indispensable tool in your daily work activities.\n"
