Later in this course, we will take a closer look at the JavaScript language itself, and we will also see how it can be used in Node.js (outside of the Web browser). However, in this one-day session, we will learn just a few things about using JavaScript within the Web browser. For now, we will focus on how JavaScript can add behavioral functionality to a page rendered in a browser and make it come alive.\n",

In many cases, you can view the result in your browser just by double clicking on the ```.html``` file directly in your file system. In some code examples, it may only work if you host the page on an actual web server. It is easiest for you to use a local development web server for this, rather deploying it to a remote production web server over the internet. A local web server can be run using Node.js. You can google that to see the details of how you can can do that.
